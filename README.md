Stata commands to estimate the panel data stochastic frontier models of
the first and second generation written and maintained by Oleg Badunenko

# Installation

First, the tool to install from GitHub is required. It can be installed by typing in the Stata command line:

```stata
net install github, from("https://haghish.github.io/github/")
```

typical search is performed by typing

```stata
github search sf
```
which provides tools for installation. The package can be installed directly by typing

```stata
github install OlegBadunenko/sf-panel-3rd-gen
```

The package can be installed without the *github* command:

```stata
net install xtsf3g, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OlegBadunenko/sf-panel-3td-gen/main")
```

# Help

Help files after installation can be called as usual:

```stata
help xtsf3gpss1
```
for the PSS model of type I

```stata
help xtsf3gpss2
```
for the PSS model of type II

```stata
help xtsf3gpss3
```
for the PSS model of type III

and

```stata
help xtsf3gkss
```
for the KSS model.
